What is C4  Model?

The C4 model is a simple, hierarchical way to describe and visualize software architecture, created by Simon Brown. Think of it as Google Maps for your code: you can zoom in and out to see different levels of detail.

C4 stands for: Context → Containers → Components → Code

Understand the 4 Levels
Level	Question it answers	Typical audience	What you show
Level 1: System Context	Who uses the system and what external systems does it interact with?	Everyone	People + the software system as a single black box + external systems
Level 2: Containers	What are the high-level technical building blocks?	Developers & architects	Web app, mobile app, database, API, message bus, etc.
Level 3: Components	How is each container internally organized?	Developers	Packages, services belül a containerben
Level 4: Code	Implementation details (optional)	Developers	Class diagrams, sequence diagrams (usually generated by tools)

Level 1: System Context (The Big Picture)

Analogy: A view of the entire continent. Audience: Non-technical stakeholders, Project Managers, Product Owners, Architects.

This diagram shows your software system as a single box in the center, surrounded by its users and the other systems it interacts with.

Focus: Who uses the system? What external systems (e.g., Email System, Mainframe, Stripe API) does it rely on?

No Tech: Do not show protocols, databases, or servers here.

Level 2: Container Diagram (The High-Level Tech)

Analogy: Zooming in to a country or state. Audience: Architects, Developers, Ops/DevOps.

Crucial Note: In C4, a "Container" is not necessarily a Docker container. It is a deployable unit that executes code or stores data.

Examples: Single Page Application (SPA), Mobile App, API Server, Database, File System.

Focus: Show the high-level technology choices (e.g., "React," "Java Spring Boot," "PostgreSQL") and how they communicate (e.g., "HTTPS/JSON," "JDBC").

Level 3: Component Diagram (The Internals)

Analogy: Zooming in to a city grid. Audience: Developers and Architects.

This diagram takes one specific Container (from Level 2) and zooms inside it.

Focus: Identification of structural components (e.g., Controllers, Services, Repositories) inside a deployable unit.

Detail: Show interfaces and dependencies. This is usually the lowest level of diagramming you do manually. 

Level 4: Code (The Details)

Analogy: Zooming in to a specific house. Audience: Developers.

This is essentially a UML Class diagram.

Recommendation: Avoid drawing this manually. It becomes obsolete the moment you write new code. Generate this automatically using IDE tools if absolutely necessary.




Recommended Tools to Draw C4 Diagrams
Structurizr (official, https://structurizr.com) – best for code-as-diagrams (DSL)
Free Structurizr Lite (local Docker)
Paid cloud version
Structurizr DSL (text → diagrams) – this is what we used above
IcePanel – beautiful drag-and-drop, collaborative
Draw.io / diagrams.net + C4 template (free)
Mermaid.js with mermaid-c4 plugin (works in Markdown, Obsidian, GitHub)
PlantUML + C4-PlantUML extension (very popular)
